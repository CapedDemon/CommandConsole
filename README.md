<h1 align="center">CommandConsole</h1>
<br>
As the name suggests this is a terminal like software. Like a normal terminal in linux or command prompt in windows, it also works like the same. It is made using C++ language and my motive of building this software is to refresh my C++ language skills and to make something which can take command and work.

<br/>
The main program is written in the main.cpp file and the functions written there are in there individual files and I have made them header files and included them where it is necessary. All the code is written in C++ language. I have included CommandConsole.exe file of the main.c++ file. I have run it in my system and it worked fine doing all the things.

## **GETTING STARTED**

![](https://github.com/Shreejan-35/CommandConsole/blob/main/images/Download.jpg)

If you have docker installed then it is very good. The steps to execute the software using docker are as follows:-

- type :-

```
docker run -it shreejan35/commandconsole:version (The latest version is available in the releases).
```

_Try to use the laterst version which is bug free_

- It will pull the image from the docker hub.
- When all the things are done it will start the program.
- It will be like a normal terminal. First of all type 'list' then check that all the files which are there in the github are shown there.
- Don't do anything there or else the software will not work as that is the only working directory.
- I have made another directory for you all, i.e, home. Go there by using 'ccwd' command.
- Finally test all the commands.
- Here is my docker repository link - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/shreejan35/commandconsole

You can clone my repository by executing this:-

```
git clone https://github.com/Shreejan-35/CommandConsole.git
```

**To run CommandConsole in linux/unix run:-**

```
sudo apt-get install wine
wine CommandConsole.exe
```

You can also download the zip file, and then run the CommandConsole.exe file.

**Prerequisite**

- Git need to be installed
- The folder or directory in which you have kept the application need to have the name CommandConsole or else there can be some error.

## **HISTORY**

> Probably saying the Command Console is written in C which you can check in the previous versions/releases.
> But with modern days comes modern tech. which is needed. That's why it is implemented in c++.
